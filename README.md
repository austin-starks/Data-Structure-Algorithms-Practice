# Data-Structure-Algorithms-Practice

A study guide for implementing data structures and algorithms

To study: go down the curriculum and answer the questions. Then, implement the
function in the "Blank" files. In tests, change the import statements to import
the blank version of the files

The following data structures are implemented in Python (and are located in the curriculum.py file):

Data Structures:
  - Linked list
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Tree
  - Trie
  - Binary Search Tree

Algorithms:
  - Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal algorithms (BST.py)
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort

The following data structures are implemented in Python (and are located in the curriculum.java file):

Data Structures:
  - Array (resizable)
  - Heap
  - Hash Table/Set
  - Linked Hash map

Algorithms:
  - Quick sort
  - Merge sort
  - Bubble sort
  - A\* Search
  - Dijkstraâ€™s

To be decided:
  - DFS
  - BFS
